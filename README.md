# Operationalised - Adversary Tactics: PowerShell

We had some PowerShell training as an item on our training wishlist. Shortly after that list was made, SpecterOps released their [Adversary Tactics: Powershell](https://github.com/specterops/at-ps) course on github.

When I viewed the material I could see that it was (a) excellent and (b) really hard to follow and work with. This is not SpecterOps fault though - the course was very obviously designed to be done with a live presenter in a lab environment and with a lot of interaction and practical work. 

To make this more digestable for online internal training purposes, I chunked the course up into topics and I extracted the labs (leaving a placecard in the slides indicating that a particular lab should be done before continuiing). 

I put the chunked up slides into an LMS (Moodle) and I added the labs as simple interactive elements in the same LMS. I also included the supplementary material provided (files, images etc.).

I added the labs as database activities in Moodle. There were multiple options for doing this, but I wanted this to be a bit of a set and forget type of thing for me and didn't want to assess participants. Rather, the lab exercise is provided when you click on the activity, the participant goes and does it, then they upload their answer. When they do this, they can see (a) the "official" provided by SpecterOps and (b) all of the other submissions made by other participants. This approach is in line with social constructivist pedagogy.

While we don't have completion tracking turned on for this training (it's not compulsory), it could be turned on if we decided that we wanted to make sure people were doing the work.
